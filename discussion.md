# Introduction

# Grammars

*Grammars* are used to define the syntax formal languages, and are typically (part of) the input to generic parsers or parser generators.  We will be interested in a class of grammars known as *context-free* grammars.

## Motivational Example

To motivate *context-free* grammars, let's consider the syntax of arithmetic expressions.  We will suppose that we have the typical operators `+ - * /`, parenthesis for grouping `()` and for simplicity we'll only consider expressions involving non-negative integers (`0 1 2 ...`).  Here are some simple arithmetic expressions:

* `1`
* `1 + 2`
* `1 + 2 * 3`
* `(1 + 2) * 3`
* `1 * 2 + 3`
* `(1 * 2) + 3`

In general, we can notice some patterns.  Let `n` be a placeholder for a non-negative integers.

* If `E` is an expression, then so is `E + n` (likewise for `- * /`)
* If `E` is an expression, then so is `(E)`

In fact, we can summarize the syntax of all expressions we've been considering as follows:

* `n` is an expression, where `n` is a non-negative integers
* if `E1` and `E2` are expressions, then so is `E1 op E2` where `op` is one of `+ - * /`
* if `E` is an expression, then so is `(E)`

Before continuing, you should convince yourself that the above description includes all the examples previously given.

## Formal Grammars

We're now prepared to define grammars more formally.  Once we've done that, we will use them to parse formal languages (e.g. arithmetic expressions or programming languages).

According to [wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Formal_grammar)

> In formal language theory, a grammar (when the context is not given, often called a formal grammar for clarity) describes how to form strings from a language's alphabet that are valid according to the language's syntax. A grammar does not describe the meaning of the strings or what can be done with them in whatever contextâ€”only their form. A formal grammar is defined as a set of production rules for such strings in a formal language.

This sounds similar to how we've tried to describe the syntax of arithmetic expressions, but they've used the jargon *production rule*, which we haven't introduced.  It will be useful to first give the grammar of arithmetic expressions, then elaborate the definition.

```
# Arithmetic Expressions Grammar 1
Start: Expression

    Expression -> number
    Expression -> Expression op Expression
    Expression -> ( Expression )

    number -> 0 | 1 | 2 | ...
    op -> + | - | * | /
```

So, this is a nice little chart or something, what are we supposed to do with it?  The basic idea is this.  Suppose you want to make an arithmetic expression.  Start with the `Expression` symbol.  Now you have three choices, either turn `Expression` into `number`, `Expression op Expression`, or `( Expression )`.  Take the second choice, now you have `Expression op Expression`.  Now you have to choose what to do with those symbols too.  Let the `Expression`s turn into `number`, and `op` turn into `+`.  Then we'd have `number + number`.  Finally, let the `number`s turn into `0`, and you get `0 + 0`.  To summarize, we made the following transformations:

`Expression -> Expression op Expression -> number + number -> 0 + 0`

## Formal Grammars, More Formally

 Formally, a *context-free grammar*, or simply *grammar*, is given by:

 1. Two lists of symbols, the *terminals* and *non-terminals*
 2. A *start-symbol*, which is a *non-terminal*
 3. A list of *production rules*.  Each *production rule* consists of:
    * A *non-terminal* called the *head*
    * A sequence of *terminals* and *non-terminals* called the *body*

The __*language*__ of a *grammar* is all sequences of *terminals* which can be created by expanding *non-terminals* (recursively), starting with the *start-symbol*.  By "recursively expanding" we mean that if you expand a *non-terminal*, and it creates more *non-terminals*, you can continue expanding them.

These definitions are sufficiently rigorous, without being overly formal.  See [wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Context-free_grammar) for more discussion.  We will instead look at the the implementation of a grammar used here.

### `grammar.py`

Here is our definition of a grammar:

```py
# grammar.py
@dataclass
class Grammar:
    name: str
    terminals: T.List[NamedTerminal]
    productions: T.List[TProduction]
    start_symbol: THead
    examples: T.Dict[str, str]
```

Note that we use the following convention in all files: `import typing as T`.  `grammar.py` uses the following defintions from `common_types.py`:

```py
# common_types.py
NamedTerminal = T.Tuple[str, str]
THead = str
TBody = str
TProduction = T.Tuple[THead, TBody]
```

These types correspond to the definition of a *grammar* one-to-one, except for the `NamedTerminal`.  The `NamedTerminal` is given by a `name`, and a `pattern`.  The pattern will be used for lexical analysis (discussed below), and the name corresponds to the *terminal* from the definition.

The first thing to point out is that `Grammar` has no "list of *non-terminals*."  These are given implicitly in the productions.  The `terminals` field exists primarily because it is convenient for lexical analysis.  The `examples` field is pure convenience, and arguably should be excluded.

It's worth noting, that with some reasonable conventions, a grammar can be given completely by its list of productions `productions: T.List[TProduction]`.  We suppose that all *non-terminals* appear in the head of at least one `production`, and that *non-terminals* are given in `PascalCase` and *terminals* are given in `snake_case`.  Then we can tell if a symbol is a *terminal* by checking if the first character is lower case.  We could also suppose that the first *head* of the first *production* is the start symbol.

Indeed this was the original implementation, and those are good conventions to follow even if you have a more elaborated definition of a grammar.  The more elaborate definition proved to be more convenient while testing and refactoring.

# Parsers

Suppose we would like to interpret arithmetic expressions in some text, and evaluate them given the values of the variables.
